                Store pick-up is a delivery option that lets buyers collect their 
                purchased item(s) from a physical store instead of the conventional delivery
                method. Store pick-up provides buyers with an additional option in 
                receiving their parcel(s) with zero shipping fees.

                <strong>1. What if I cannot go to the store within 14 days?</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                You may ask a representative to collect on your behalf. Do provide them
                with the QR code, so that the staff will be able to verify your order. If the
                QR code is wrong/not provided, you will not able to collect the order.
                If neither you nor your representative is able to 
                go to the store within the timeframe, the order 
                will be automatically cancelled and the cost will 
                be refunded to you.

                <strong>2. Can I change my delivery method after selecting store pick-up?</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                No, once your order is confirmed, you won't be able to change to a different delivery 
                method. If you'd like to do so, you can cancel your existing order and place a new one to
                change the delivery method.
